# `crazy-cardgame` Grade Report

Each category has bullet points for some of the relevant factors that
go into determining your grade. Meeting every one of the bullet points
is _not_ necessarily sufficient for a perfect score in that category;
they only serve as general guidelines.

## Overall Design

 - Solution approach is well thought out
 - Code is logically organized
 - Avoids unnecessary repetition ("Don't repeat yourself")

## Object Decomposition

 - The purpose of each class/object is clear and well thought out
 - Classes have good cohesion (related things together) and loose coupling (unrelated things separated)
 - Classes are at the appropriate granularity (not too big and not too small)
 - Functions are appropriately static (if they donâ€™t operate on an object) or non-static (if they do)

## Naming and Layout

 - Names succinctly and accurately describe the named entity
 - Consistent braces, indentation, line length/wrapping
 - Horizontal and vertical whitespace group related, separate unrelated things
 - Naming and layout meet (Google Java) coding style guidelines

## Automatic Testing

 - Important classes of inputs are tested (valid, invalid/errors, boundary)
 - Tests well documented through naming (or comments if necessary)
 - Tests are well-organized (logical grouping/order, generally one assertion per test)

## Process

 - Code was checked-in periodically/progressively in logical chunks
 - Meaningful commit messages

## Presentation

 - Arrived on time will all necessary materials and ready to go
 - Good selection of topics to focus on and logical order of presentation
 - Appropriate pacing and engagement of the fellow students
 - Speaking loud enough and enunciating clearly

## Participation

 - Engaged and paying attention to other students presentations
 - Asks questions and/or makes comments that further the discussion
 - Explains reasoning for why something is good or bad
 - Behaves respectfully to moderator and other students
